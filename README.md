    <h2>How to make a cup of coffee</h2>
    <p>
Making a simple cup of coffee can often make or break someone's day, so let's start by 
      attempting to make it a good one with a good cup of coffee
        <br />
        Ingredients
      <ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Water</li>
</ol>

  Feel free to add any flavoring or creams as desired AFTER the coffee has been properly brewed :) 
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
       After you have prepared your brewing choice of caffinated goodness, and your setup is compelete its time to start up that coffee maker!
        <hr />
        <ul>
  <li>Usng 1TBLS for every 2 cups, scoop your grounds into your filter</li>
  <li>Make sure your brewer has cold water provided; it will heat up as it brews</li>
  <li>Flip the "ON" switch and sit back and wait</li>
</ul>

Making a cup too strong is technically a choice, but only some enjoy overly flavorful coffee. So it's important to use your preferred coffee-to-water ratio regularly
and get the hang of a set amount to make a good taste and caffeinating. But as mentioned, its entirely up to you, if you enjoy a coffee so strong that you cringe, by all means!
